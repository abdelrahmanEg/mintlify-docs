This is the shortest path to demo **AQL**: create an account, pick a workspace, start a free trial or buy a subscription, then try AI features.

## 1) Create your account
- **Sign in / Sign up** with **Facebook**, **Google**, or **Email + Phone**.
- Complete any verification steps if prompted.

## 2) Choose your workspace
- On entry, you’ll see **Workspaces** you can access.
- Select a workspace and **Start Free Trial** or **Buy Subscription**.

## 3) Tour the Workspace Home
- **Workspace name** at the top.
- **Subscription details** (plan & renewal).
- **Tokens summary** used by **AQL GenAI** and **AI Knowledge Assistant**.

## 4) Try the AI features (left sidebar)
- **AI Knowledge (RAG):** upload a few FAQs, index, then ask questions.
- **AI Knowledge Assistant:** ask a policy or product question; check citations.
- **AQL GenAI (LLM):** try a simple prompt and a streaming response.

## 5) Invite a teammate (optional)
- Go to **Workspace Settings → Team** and invite by email with the right role.

> Tip: Keep demo content simple (3–5 FAQs) and use short, clear questions.
