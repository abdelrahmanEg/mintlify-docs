# AI Overview

AQL brings together three core capabilities:

- **AI Knowledge (RAG)**: Ground responses on your indexed docs (policies, FAQs, handbooks).
- **AI Knowledge Assistant**: Natural-language Q&A with citations to your sources.
- **AQL GenAI (LLM)**: General chat, streaming responses, and structured outputs.

Use **RAG** for accuracy on your content; use **GenAI** for generative tasks.
